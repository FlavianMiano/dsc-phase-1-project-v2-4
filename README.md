They contains a large number of public data on films such as the title of the film, the year of release of the film, the genre of the film, the audience, the rating of critics, the duration of the film, the summary of the film, actors, directors and much more. Faced with the large amount of data available on this sites. I will use them for this analysis.
# Project Overview

## Conclusion

    * The genre with the most number of movies out
    * The release year and its effect on the gross income/profit
    * The average domestic gross of the movies.



## Recommendation
    * Microsoft should use English for most movies while also producing movies focused on the other native languages so as to increase their fan base. They can also include subtitles in the other native languages
    * While starting out, they could collaborate with the bigger already established companies in order to get their presence known quicker.
    * They should major on the production of the movie genres that have the highest number of movies out (Supply and demand).
    * They should not only focus on the most common genres because there is a wide range of likes from the fan base that would like to see other types of genres.
    * In this age and time of the internet they should most definitely get into the movie business.
